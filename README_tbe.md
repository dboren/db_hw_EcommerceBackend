# E-commerce Backend


## Value Add Proposal

App allows user to create and seed a database of products, categories, and tags, and to view, add to, update, and delete from each of those tables via api routes.


## Tech Stack

Application demonstrates ability with javascript, mysql, Sequelize, node, and express.


## MVP

### Phase One

Server and connection files were configured and models were created for the tables product, category, tag, and product tag. This is then used along with starter sql files to create and seed the e-commerce database.


### Phase Two

API routes are created for the three primary tables to allow use of the get, post, put, and delete http requests. All routes added use async/await format and sequelize methods.
